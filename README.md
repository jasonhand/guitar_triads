# ðŸŽ¸ Guitar Triads Master

An interactive web application for learning and mastering guitar triads through visualization and practice exercises. This educational tool helps guitarists understand triad theory, visualize chord shapes on the fretboard, and develop their musical knowledge through engaging exercises.

## What This Project Is

Guitar Triads Master is a comprehensive learning platform that combines music theory with interactive practice. It provides:

- **Interactive Fretboard Visualization**: A realistic guitar fretboard showing all 12 frets across 6 strings
- **Multiple Triad Types**: Support for major, minor, diminished, and augmented triads
- **Position-Based Learning**: Focus on specific fret ranges (0-3, 2-5, 4-7, 6-9, 8-12) or view all positions
- **Practice Exercises**: Three different exercise modes to test and improve your knowledge
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor your learning with accuracy statistics and streak counters

## How It Works

### Core Features

1. **Triad Visualization**
   - Select any root note (C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B)
   - Choose from four triad types (major, minor, diminished, augmented)
   - Select proper inversion (root position, first inversion, second inversion)
   - Choose from standard 3-string sets used in guitar pedagogy:
     - Strings 6-5-4 (E-A-D) - most common for root position triads
     - Strings 5-4-3 (A-D-G) - popular for inversions and middle register
     - Strings 4-3-2 (D-G-B) - higher register triads
     - Strings 3-2-1 (G-B-E) - highest register triads
   - Optionally filter by fret position ranges
   - Notes are color-coded: Root (red), Third (teal), Fifth (blue)
   - Visual guitar nut representation with thicker line between open strings and first fret

2. **Interactive Exercises**
   - **Identify Triad Notes**: Click on specific notes within displayed triads (includes inversion awareness)
   - **Build Triads**: Construct triads by clicking the correct fretboard positions with proper inversion
   - **Recognize Triad Type**: Identify both the triad type and inversion of displayed triads

3. **Educational Information**
   - Real-time display of triad components (root, third, fifth notes)
   - Clear inversion labeling with bass note identification
   - Detailed descriptions of each triad type's interval structure and inversion characteristics
   - Visual legend for easy note identification

4. **Progress Tracking**
   - Correct answer count
   - Total questions attempted
   - Accuracy percentage
   - Current streak of correct answers

### Technical Implementation

- **Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: No external dependencies or frameworks
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Mathematical Music Theory**: Uses chromatic intervals to calculate triad notes
- **Standard Guitar Tuning**: E-A-D-G-B-E (low to high)

## Why This Project Is Important

### For Guitar Players
- **Fundamental Knowledge**: Triads are the building blocks of most guitar chords and progressions
- **Standard Pedagogy**: Follows established guitar teaching methods with proper string sets and inversion theory
- **Inversion Mastery**: Teaches root position, first inversion, and second inversion - essential for chord progressions and voice leading
- **Practical 3-String Approach**: Focuses on the most common and playable string combinations used in real guitar instruction
- **Fretboard Familiarity**: Develops navigation skills across the four primary triad string sets (6-5-4, 5-4-3, 4-3-2, 3-2-1)
- **Pattern Recognition**: Builds visual and muscle memory for standard triad fingerings and inversions
- **Bass Note Awareness**: Teaches the critical concept of which note is in the bass for different inversions

### For Music Education
- **Visual Learning**: Combines auditory concepts with visual representation
- **Interactive Practice**: Engaging exercises that reinforce theoretical knowledge
- **Self-Paced Learning**: Students can practice at their own speed and difficulty level
- **Progress Tracking**: Measurable improvement through statistics and feedback

### For Music Theory Understanding
- **Interval Relationships**: Shows how major thirds, minor thirds, and perfect/diminished/augmented fifths create different triad qualities
- **Inversion Theory**: Demonstrates how the same three notes create different harmonic functions based on the bass note
- **Voice Leading**: Teaches smooth voice leading principles through close-position triad inversions
- **Harmonic Function**: Shows how inversions affect the stability and function of chords in progressions
- **Enharmonic Equivalents**: Handles notes like C# and Db correctly
- **Pattern Recognition**: Helps identify recurring patterns across the fretboard and between different inversions

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
2. Select a root note, triad type, string set, and inversion
3. Click "Show Triad" to visualize the triad on the fretboard
4. Try the practice exercises to test your knowledge of notes, construction, and recognition
5. Track your progress as you improve your triad mastery

## Educational Value

This tool bridges the gap between theoretical music knowledge and practical guitar application. Understanding triads and their inversions is essential for:
- Playing smooth chord progressions with proper voice leading
- Understanding bass movement in harmony and chord progressions
- Creating sophisticated arrangements using different triad inversions
- Improvising with awareness of chord tones and their functions
- Reading and interpreting advanced chord charts and lead sheets
- Developing overall musicianship and harmonic understanding

The focus on proper inversions teaches students how the same three notes can create different harmonic colors and functions depending on which note is in the bass - a fundamental concept for any serious guitarist or musician.

Whether you're a beginner learning your first chords or an advanced player looking to master sophisticated harmony, Guitar Triads Master provides an engaging and pedagogically sound way to deepen your understanding of guitar harmony and music theory.
